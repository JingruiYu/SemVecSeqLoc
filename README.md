# SemVecSeqLoc

SemVecSeqLoc is a MATLAB-based repository for visual localization using semantic vector representation and sequence information. The project aims to provide a robust solution for the visual localization challenge, which is essential in the fields of computer vision and robotics.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Vector Representation**: Utilizes semantic vectors to encapsulate the visual content of images, facilitating efficient and compact image representation.
- **Sequence Information Utilization**: Enhances localization accuracy by incorporating sequence information from image streams.
- **Visual Localization Application**: Focuses on determining the camera's position and orientation based on visual inputs, a critical task in autonomous systems and robotics.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, ensure MATLAB is installed on your system. Run the main script to initiate the visual localization process, which involves loading images, extracting semantic vectors and sequence information, followed by the localization computation.
